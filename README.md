Environment and prerequisites are the same as in apk_wow (base repo).

Once you've got the docker container running as explained in apk_wow README.md, 
running "mod" or "modify" here will create my the apk with my modifications.

Check out "mods.cs" to see which modifications exactly are implemented. You can also customize
it by selecting which modifications to invoke in the main function or even add or change functions.

That's all. Again feel free to post in the discussions or reach out.
My contacts are also in apk_wow/README.md
